When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When i work on different machines, or if someone else works with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Maybe if i don`t want to share some of my local commits or branches.
