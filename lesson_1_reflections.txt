2.2 It allows to write parallel versions of code and then decide what version is better

3 Multi file commits
3.1 Some VCS allow to save multiple files in one commit because is git is code-oriented and
while you programming some of your files are interdependent. So whe you change one file, this
change refers to another files.

4.1 I can use git log for seeing all commits and git diff to see the changes itself: 
added and removed lines for example

5 Checkout commits for restoring older versions without deleting last versions. For ex while searching bugs.

6. Like i said, it`s useful for searching bugs? make alternate versions of soft without breaking old versions
and to organise your code to write it with discipline.
