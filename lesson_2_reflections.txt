When i create a new empty repository a git folder is created. It tracks 0 files for a moment and has 0 commits. 
I must add some file to track and create a commit myself as git didn`t do this for me.

Working folder contains all the files, that are tracked or untracked.
Staging area represents a set of files ( or 1 file ) that are tracked and will be added to each commit.
Repository is the collection of commits.

By having a staging area we can choose which changes in which commit are going.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
- It`s boring)
- Git doesn`t merge files if some conflict exists between the same code, you have to choose which version will be saved or what to save. So it`s pretty useful - when it adds or removes some code it does it in straightforward cases.
