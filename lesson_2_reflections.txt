When i create a new empty repository a git folder is created. It tracks 0 files for a moment and has 0 commits. 
I must add some file to track and create a commit myself as git didn`t do this for me.

Working folder contains all the files, that are tracked or untracked.
Staging area represents a set of files ( or 1 file ) that are tracked and will be added to each commit.
Repository is the collection of commits.

By having a staging area we can choose which changes in which commit are going.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- Developing a new feature without breaking working app.
- Creating new versions of a product (languages, modes, etc).

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- They show me commits relationships, reacheble commits.
